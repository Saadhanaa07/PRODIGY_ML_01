# 🏡 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project uses **Linear Regression** to predict the **sale price of houses** based on features such as:

- Square footage of the house (GrLivArea)
- Number of bedrooms above ground (BedroomAbvGr)
- Number of full bathrooms (FullBath)

The dataset used is from the **[House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)** Kaggle competition.
